Here are examples of python code that processes biomechanical data. 

Force_Plate_Data_CMJ_JumpHeight:

**GOAL:** Process force plate data to calculate jump height from a countermovement jump (CMJ)

1. Caluclate the jump height using the Impulse-Momentum Theorem for each trial in the raw dataset.
2. Calculate the average of the 3 trials for each training/ testing session.
3. Plot the average jump heights as a bar graph for each of the 4 training/ testing sessions.

Running_MoCap_Data:

**GOAL:** Process biomechanical data which include motion analysis of a running trial with 40 strides. 

1. Calculate the average joint angles across strides for the hip, knee, and ankle during stance phase.
2. Plot the average joint angle time series data in each plane.
3. Calculate the average vertical ground reaction force (GRF) or y-axis.
4. Plot the vertical GFRs time series data.

Treadmill_Data_Vaporfly

***GOAL:** Process biomechanical data extracted from the plantar pressure treadmill
